This addon brings up a variety of powerful relics, mostly oriented to expand the horizons of mid- and endgame. Most of them are designed to serve you in battles, but there are some utilitary ones. Except it's up to you to decide how you will use each of them.

It was created by Integral. But, guess what? This nickname seems to be already taken almost everywhere. So he is also known as "Extegral", "VictorShadow", "VictorShadow_" and some more names.
