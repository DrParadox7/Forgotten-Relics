# Forgotten Relics

**Current Version:** 1.7.0 Beta

**Minecraft Version:** 1.7.10

**Dependencies:** Thaumcraft 4.2.3.5; Botania r1.8-237 or later

This addon brings up a variety of powerful relics, mostly oriented to expand the horizons of mid- and endgame. Most of them are designed to serve you in battles, but there are some utilitary ones. Except it's up to you to decide how you will use each of them.

It was originally created by Integral. But, guess what? This nickname seems to be already taken almost everywhere. So he is also known as "Extegral", "VictorShadow", "VictorShadow_" and some more names.

**To-Do List for the nearest future:**

**Funny Fact #192-17MK2:** Ironically, Superposition Handler has nothing to do with Ring of Superposition. Not directly, at least.
