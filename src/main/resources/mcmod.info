It all mostly goes to Thaumcraft side, but some relics are supposed to be a logical inheritors of Botania's things. There's also a variety of stuff inspired by and based on Terraria and Terraria's mods, especially Calamity and Thorium, even though it may not be very recognizable visually because of the freakin' copyright and all the pain in the ass that it brings.
This mod and everything it includes (except memes) is distributed under WTFPL license.",
