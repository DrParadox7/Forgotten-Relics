You face an addon to Thaumcraft 4 and Botania, that adds tools and accesories, generally oriented on expansion of mid- and end-game content, offering you weapons of unmatched power. It all mostly goes to Thaumcraft side, but some relics are supposed to be a logical inheritors of Botania's things. There's also a variety of stuff inspired by and based on Terraria and Terraria's mods, especially Calamity and Thorium.",
